# Waveform-Clustering-MSA-Project-Week

MSA Project Week was hosted by Cox Communications.

Their overarching problem statement had 4 parts:
1. Discover a way to cluster array like Full Band Capture (FBC) Amplitude Waveform data by Node and measure precision of clustering accuracy.
2. Detect WAVE and INGRESS impairments in the FBC Waveforms
3. Using the network parent to child relationships, discover a way to algorithmically find the most common ancestor of any collection of address network elements and visualize this. 
4. Find a way to losslessly compress the FBC raw signal for easier access in Hive Hadoop.
